name: session-close
description: Close out the current journal session. Invoke only when the user explicitly asks to close, wrap up, or end the current session. Requires prior session-setup, commits work, opens PRs, waits for review, squash-merges, updates local default branches, then writes SUMMARY.md and updates INDEX.md in the developer's personal journal branch per .session.md. Does not accept arguments.

The user is **closing the current session**. Follow the session protocol defined in `.session.md` at the workspace root — do not restate it, follow it.

The close-out has three phases: **verify the personal journal worktree**, **land the work**, then **record the session**. Do them in order. Do not write `SUMMARY.md` before the PRs are merged — the summary is a postmortem of what actually happened, not what you intend to happen.

---

## Phase 0 — Verify the personal journal worktree

Resolve the developer identity with `gh api user --jq .login`, then locate an
existing Worktrunk worktree for `journal/<login>` with `wt list --format=json`
and use that worktree as the journal root. If no worktree exists, stop and tell
the developer to run `session-setup` before closing a session. Do not create the
journal branch here. In the journal worktree, require `git status --short` to be
clean, run `git pull --rebase`, and verify `.journal/INDEX.md`,
`.journal/SKILLS.md`, and `.journal/TECH_NOTES.md` exist. If the root journal
files are missing, stop and tell the developer to rerun `session-setup`.

## Phase 1 — Land the work

For **every repo** with uncommitted changes or an unmerged session branch, walk through these steps. Do not skip a repo because "nothing really changed" — run `git status` and verify.

1. **Reject journal contamination.** In every non-journal implementation branch, run `git ls-files .journal`. If it prints any tracked file, stop and remove those files from the implementation branch before continuing. Only `journal/<login>` may use `git add -f .journal`.
2. **Commit all changes.** In each worktree that has work, stage and commit with a clear message. If there are logically distinct changes, use multiple commits. Do not commit unrelated changes together (see the Worktrunk rule in `.session.md`: one worktree per PR).
3. **Push the branch.** `git push -u origin HEAD` if the branch has no upstream; `git push` otherwise.
4. **Open a PR.** Use `gh pr create` with a title and body that explain the change. If multiple repos have work, open one PR per repo (or per logical change, if a repo has more than one). Surface the PR URL to the user.
5. **Wait for user review.** After opening each PR, **stop and wait** for the user to review. Do not proceed to merge on your own. The user will indicate when a PR is approved and ready to merge — possibly after requesting changes that you then address in additional commits. Never merge unreviewed.
6. **Squash-merge after approval.** Once the user approves, merge with `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`. **Always squash.** Never use `--merge` or `--rebase`. This applies to every PR in every repo for this session, without exception.
7. **Update the local default branch.** After merge, in the main (non-worktree) checkout of that repo, detect the default branch with `git remote show origin | sed -n 's/  HEAD branch: //p'` (do not assume `main` or `master`), then fetch and fast-forward: `git fetch origin && git checkout <default> && git pull --ff-only`. If fast-forward fails, stop and surface the problem to the user rather than resolving via merge or reset.
8. **Remove the session worktree.** Once the branch is merged and the local default is updated, clean up the Worktrunk worktree with `wt remove` (see the `worktrunk` skill). Do not leave stale worktrees.

Repeat for each repo. Only once **every** PR for the session is merged and **every** local default branch is fast-forwarded should you move to Phase 2.

If the user decides to abandon rather than merge one of the PRs, close it with `gh pr close` and delete the branch; record the abandonment explicitly in `SUMMARY.md` under Outcome or Open Threads.

## Phase 2 — Record the session

Only after Phase 1 is complete:

1. **Write `SUMMARY.md`** at `<journal-root>/.journal/<ID>/SUMMARY.md` using `references/session-artifacts.md`. It is a postmortem written for another agent reading cold — cover goal, outcome (state plainly whether it was met), key decisions with reasons, changes, open threads, and references.
2. **Update `<journal-root>/.journal/INDEX.md`.** Add or update the row for this session. Set `Status` to `complete` (or `abandoned` if the work was dropped). Keep the summary cell to one sentence. Rows stay ordered oldest → newest.
3. **Update `<journal-root>/.journal/TECH_NOTES.md` if needed.** If the session produced durable technical context, revise the notes file so future agents inherit it. Keep it small; do not copy the session log into it.
4. **Append a final `NOTES.md` entry** using `references/session-artifacts.md`, pointing at the merged PRs and summarizing the hand-off state. `NOTES.md` is append-only — do not rewrite prior entries.
5. **Commit and push the journal mutation.** In the personal journal worktree, commit with `docs(journal): close session <ID>` and push `journal/<login>`. If the push is rejected, fetch/rebase once and retry once; if conflicts remain, stop and surface them.
6. **Confirm to the user** what was recorded: the session ID, the PRs merged, the repos whose local default was updated, the fact that `SUMMARY.md` and `INDEX.md` were written, whether `TECH_NOTES.md` was updated, and which journal branch was pushed.

Do not skip the review-and-wait step in Phase 1. The whole point of opening PRs instead of merging locally is that the user sees the changes on GitHub before they land. Merging without explicit approval is a principle violation even if the change looks obviously correct.
