## 2026-05-21 17:30 — Kickoff
Goal for the session: start a new YACD journal session; the concrete
implementation or research goal is still pending from the user.
Current state of the world: journal branch `journal/jmgilman` is present,
clean, and current with origin. Recent closed sessions completed the
cardano-testnet tools image/init fragment, the primary `CardanoNetwork`
workload, and primary node Service/status/readiness. The remaining known
phase-2 follow-up from session 006 is current-state documentation drift,
especially README text that still describes the reconciler as future work.
Plan: wait for the user's actual request. Once implementation work starts,
select or create an implementation Worktrunk worktree, run the required
`moon run root:dev-up` startup step there unless explicitly waived, and keep
the session notes updated at meaningful checkpoints.

## 2026-05-21 17:35 — Phase 3 shape
Goal for the checkpoint: read `.journal/PLAN.md` phase 3 and propose the
initial internal type shape for generating the Ogmios sidecar, Service, and
status endpoint.
What was reviewed: phase 3 targets shared ephemeral node IPC, an Ogmios
sidecar in the primary node Pod, a ClusterIP Ogmios Service, and status that
makes the Ogmios endpoint discoverable. Current `CardanoNetwork` API already
has `spec.chainAPI.ogmios` and `status.endpoints.ogmios`, so the first slice
should activate that surface instead of adding another CRD.
Proposal direction: keep Ogmios under the existing package-local
`primaryWorkloadBuilder`, add a small resolved Ogmios settings type to handle
controller-side defaults and validation, extend `primaryWorkloadResources`
with an explicit Ogmios Service, and keep sidecar rendering/status endpoint
helpers unexported in `internal/controller/cardanonetwork`.

## 2026-05-21 17:58 — Implementation start
Started implementation on Worktrunk branch `feat/ogmios-chain-api` at
`.wt/feat-ogmios-chain-api`. Ran the required session dev stack startup from
that worktree with `direnv allow && moon run root:dev-up`; it created the
`yacd-dev` Kind cluster, started Tilt, and reported `YACD dev stack is ready`.
Tilt UI is available on port `10350`, with logs under `.run/yacd-dev/tilt.log`.

## 2026-05-21 18:14 — Ogmios implementation
Implemented phase 3 on `feat/ogmios-chain-api` and pushed commit `281ef1e`
(`feat(cardanonetwork): expose ogmios chain api`). The slice adds default
Ogmios settings resolution, the sidecar mounted to the existing node IPC and
state volumes, a dedicated `<network>-ogmios` Service, Ogmios endpoint status,
`OgmiosReady`, and aggregate `Ready`. Explicit `enabled: false` removes the
owned Ogmios Service and clears the endpoint.
Validation passed with `moon run root:generate`, `moon run root:test`,
`moon run root:check`, `moon run root:test-e2e`, and `git diff --check`.
The Chainsaw smoke created `phase3-smoke`, reached `Ready=True`, verified both
node-to-node and Ogmios status endpoints, and confirmed an in-cluster curl pod
received HTTP 200 from `http://phase3-smoke-ogmios.yacd-smoke.svc.cluster.local:1337/health`.
After e2e cleanup, the kubectl context was restored to `kind-yacd-dev`; the
session dev stack remains running.
