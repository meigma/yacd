## 2026-05-24 09:12 — Kickoff
Goal for the session: Start a fresh YACD journal session and wait for the user's actual implementation, review, or research request.
Current state of the world: The journal branch `journal/jmgilman` is clean and up to date. Recent closed work completed the faucet dev-image fix, the API-only `CardanoDBSync` CRD slice, and the `CardanoNetwork` localnet artifact ConfigMap path. Local `master` is at `9ac60de` from the artifact ConfigMap merge, and the prior session stopped the dev stack.
Plan: Wait for the user's request. For implementation work, select or create the implementation Worktrunk worktree first, then run `moon run root:dev-up` there before changing runtime code unless the user explicitly waives that session startup step.

## 2026-05-24 09:39 — Implementation branch and dev stack
Goal for the session is now the phase 6 `CardanoDBSync` controller initialization slice. Created implementation branch `feat/dbsync-controller-init` at `/Users/josh/code/meigma/yacd/.wt/feat-dbsync-controller-init` from current `master` (`9ac60de`). Ran `direnv allow` and `moon run root:dev-up` from that worktree; the command completed successfully and reported the YACD dev stack ready with Tilt at `http://localhost:10350/`.

## 2026-05-24 09:46 — CardanoDBSync controller initialized
Implemented the first `CardanoDBSync` controller slice on `feat/dbsync-controller-init` and committed it as `f39e41b` (`feat(cardanodbsync): initialize controller`). The slice registers a controller, indexes `spec.networkRef.name`, watches referenced `CardanoNetwork` status updates, validates fresh artifact status plus the live artifact ConfigMap metadata, and reports dependency/workload-pending conditions without creating runtime children. Validation passed: `moon run root:generate`, targeted impacted package tests, `moon run root:test`, `moon run root:check`, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-24 10:44 — External Postgres contract added
Implemented the external Postgres prerequisite slice on `feat/dbsync-controller-init` and committed it as `2b1d8a1` (`feat(cardanodbsync): support external postgres references`). The API now requires exactly one of `spec.database.external` or `spec.database.managed`, defaults external connection fields, and preserves managed database settings under the reserved `managed` branch. The controller currently accepts only external mode, validates the same-namespace password Secret/key, watches referenced Secrets, and keeps reporting `WorkloadsPending` after database and network prerequisites are accepted. Validation passed: `moon run root:generate`, `moon run root:test`, `moon run root:check`, `git diff --check`, and `git diff --cached --check`.
